Platform (tool consumers) - Canvas LMS
Linked via deployment_id  and client_id - client_id may be re-used/shared - e.g. multple entry points from canvaslms?
Tool (tool providers) - External app providing service to the platform

Deployment_id - account identifier (e.g. canvas.ed_CBCC)
Multi-tenant - Canvas can send from different points.
e.g. oauth client_id - SMC_CBCC - deployment ids below all use same client id and public key
deployment id - 001 = department deployment
deployment id - 002 = Instructor deployment
deployment id - 002 = Quiz engine?
(single tenant means one client/deployment/security pair)


OpenID Connect, signed JWTs, and OAuth2.0 workflows for authentication.




- LMS - when clicking word/excel docs in lms app, it opens directly from the cache, saving work there then gets overwritten when syncing.
- SMC - leading 0's in user id is removed during import (not smc? excel?
- SMC - Allow parse name to only have 1 name - errors if not the right number of itemsk
